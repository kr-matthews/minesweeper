# Minesweeper

### Play

[https://kr-matthews.github.io/minesweeper/](https://kr-matthews.github.io/minesweeper/)

### Features

Classic minesweeper game where you can select a standard field dimension and mine count, or input custom parameters.

Includes flags, and you can click uncovered cells with the correct number of adjacent flags to auto-uncover all non-flagged neighbours.

Mines are randomly distributed after the first (left) click, and the first-clicked cell will have no adjacent mines whenever possible (and if not possible, then it will have minimal possible adjacency count).

### Future

Possibly including a timer and ability to save high-scores in the future.
